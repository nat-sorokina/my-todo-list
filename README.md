# My To-Do List React App

## Description
I built this project to practise React JS and review essential concepts, such as state and passing props. Inadvertently, I also brushed up on my CSS flexbox knowledge.

## Features
A user can add a task to the do-to list, mark it as “completed” and delete it off the list. I used a Font Awesome icon for deleting an item. Marking a task as “completed” puts a line through the task, thus, crossing it off the list.

## How to Use
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.
